%description
American fuzzy lop uses a novel type of compile-time instrumentation
and genetic algorithms to automatically discover clean, interesting
test cases that trigger new internal states in the targeted
binary. This substantially improves the functional coverage for the
fuzzed code. The compact synthesized corpuses produced by the tool are
also useful for seeding other, more labor- or resource-intensive
testing regimes down the road.

Compared to other instrumented fuzzers, afl-fuzz is designed to be
practical: it has a modest performance overhead, uses a variety of
highly effective fuzzing strategies, requires essentially no
configuration, and seamlessly handles complex, real-world use cases -
say, common image parsing or file compression libraries.
